HW2 - STOOGESORT

This program is written in Python. I ended up using the StoogeSort pseudocode in the StoogeSort wiki for this program.

No makefile is necessary for this program to run on FLIP. To run, type "python stoogepy.py" without the quotes. It will of course require the data.txt file to be in the same location as the program for it to read the file. 

I left in the print statements for this program. There is one before sorting and one after sorting for each set of numbers in the array. They will also be stored in the "stooge.out" file.
