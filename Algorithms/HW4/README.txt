This program is written in C++. It can be compiled on FLIP using the provided makefile. Be sure that the makefile is in the same location as the lastStart.cpp file and then simply type "make" into the command line. This will make a program object that can then be run with "./lastStart". 

The program assumes the presence of an "act.txt" file within the same directory. There is no output file that is generated and all output is outputted to the terminal.
