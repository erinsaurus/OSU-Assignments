This program is a Python program. It can be run on FLIP with the following command "python changedp.py"

I adapted my code from the pseudocode on www.geeksforgeeks.com site. 
My output shows the coins and how many of each were used in the calculation. For example, for the array of [1, 7, 11] and total value of 14, my code will output "7 7" denoting two coins of denomination 7 were used. This was approved as an ok output on this week's discussion board.

I left in the print statements for the grader to see the output more easily, but the change.txt file has the output as well.
