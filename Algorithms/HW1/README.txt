HW1

These programs have been tested on the FLIP server. I have included the makefiles that I used to compile and run these program. They can be compiled with the usual “make” command and create “InsertSort” and “MakeSort” program objects that can be run with “./InsertSort” and “./MakeSort.” 

Per the assignments instructions, these programs output to “insert.out” and “merges.out” files, so I do not have any output that prints to the screen. The output is only in the files.

I have used the pseudocode from the book as a guide to create my programs.
Note also that these are two separate programs and not in one file. They are in separate folders with their respective makefiles in the ZIP folder. Thank you
