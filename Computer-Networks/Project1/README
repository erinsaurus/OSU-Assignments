Project 1

This program consists of two files and a Bash script:

	1. chatserve.py
	2. chatclient.c
	3. chatserve

To run this program, first ensure all files are in the same directory on Flip.
Next use the command "chmod +x chatserve" (without the quotes) to get permissions for the Bash script.
The script will compile the chatclient.c file as well as initiate the chatserve.py program. After changing permissions, you can run per the instructions:

1. chmod +x chatserve
2. chatserve [port]
3. ./chatclient [server] [port]

Thank you!
