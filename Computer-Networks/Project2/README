Project 2

EXTRA CREDIT: The server is multithreaded.
The connection is created with five possible connections able to be connected. For each child, there is a loop
that performs all of the normal operations of the client/server relationship. The loop waits for all children
to be completed (and exits on SIGINT).

To compile and run this program - 

**** NOTE: THESE PROGRAMS NEED TO BE RUN ON THE SAME FLIP OR ELSE THEY WILL NOT FUNCTION ****

1. Be sure compile and ftserver.c are in the same directory
2. Type 'chmod +x compile' without the quotes OR just type 'gcc -o ftserver ftserver.c' without the quotes
3. Start the server with --- './ftserver [port number]' without the quotes
