Project 6

This is how you can compile and run these programs - 

Mult Only:

1. chmod +x mult
2. ./mult

MultAdd

1. chmod +x multAdd
2. ./multAdd

MultRed

1. chmod +x runReduce
2. ./runReduce

For all, of course be sure everything is in the same directory. The CL headers should be in their own folder within the main directory.
For all, output will be put on the screen as well as in a .csv file for ease of importing data to Excel for evaluation.
