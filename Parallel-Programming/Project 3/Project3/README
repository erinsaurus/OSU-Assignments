Project 3

This program is set up with two #ifdef #endif statements that indicate which piece of code to run. When running, for each NUMT it will first run 0-16 trials of Fix 1 with correspondening padding. Then for each NUMT it will run Fix 2.

To run:

1. First make sure run and proj3.c are in the same directory
2. Type "chmod +x run" without the quotes
3. Type "./run" without the quotes

Note that the results will also write to "results.csv" file (which I used for importing my data to Excel to create the graphs.)

Thank you!
