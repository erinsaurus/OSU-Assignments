CS475 - Project 2

This program can be run with the provided script 'run'.

After making sure proj2.c and run are in the same directory, run with the following commands:

// Get permissions to run the script

chmod +x run 

// Run the file

./run

Results will output to the terminal, but there is also a results file that will be created called results.csv (I did this to easily export results to Excel for graph/table creation).

Note that in the script I set parameters to run all four types in one file, so this should only need to be run once for all results.

Thank you!
