Project 5

To run this simulation, do the following:

1. Ensure the "run", "proj5.cpp", "simd.p5.cpp", "simd.p5.h" files are in the same directory
2. Type "chmod +x run" without the quotes
3. Type "./run" without the quotes

The results will be displayed both to the output screen and also will be stored in a "results.csv" file used for ease of adding 
data to excel for evalution.
