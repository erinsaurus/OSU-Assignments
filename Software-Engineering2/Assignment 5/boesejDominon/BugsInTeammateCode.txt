Description
===========
Summary: Deck count for the player is incorrect after calling Smithy Card function

I created an instance of the Dominion game and called the Smithy Card function.
I then ran test code to check various counts. I found that the deck count was showing an incorrect
amount of cards in the current player's deck, indicating that one card was "lost."
This error happens on every run of the Smithy Card.

Steps to Produce/Reproduce
--------------------------
Any time the Smithy Card is called this bug occurs.


Expected Results
----------------
The deck count should be the original deck count plus 3


Actual Results
--------------
The deck count showed the original plus 2


Workarounds
-----------
No known workarounds at this time

Test code output for relevant bug:

TEST 2: Three cards are drawn from the current player's deck
deck count = 1, expected = 2
TEST 2 FAILED!
